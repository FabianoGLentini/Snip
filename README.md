## Inspiration
"What if you could doomscroll your classes?"

Inspired by social media apps like TikTok, we leveraged the dopamine gained from scrolling through short form content to make exam reviewing more addicting.

##What it does
Syllabyte takes in a syllabus PDF file and generates a few shorts based on key concepts outlined. After waiting, users are able to scroll through the contents and learn while watching interesting gameplay.

##How we built it
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite Backend: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQlite 3 (ORM Active Record) AI/ML: Python, Flask, Gemini, Google TTS, GCP

##Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge would be connecting all three main components of the app. For AI/ML, there was a lot of dependency issues and connecting a React frontend with a Ruby backend was also frustrating as it's not as easily integrated as other frameworks like Node.js. After a lot of debugging, we're happy to report our app works effortlessly and all API calls works.

##What we learned
We learn how to use Google TTS, Gemini API, and GCP for the first time.

##What's next for Syllabyte
We hope to be able to do more voice customization and better explanations on the concepts from the syllabus.
